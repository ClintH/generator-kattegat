	<h1>Demos</h1>
	<p>
		The demos give you some ideas as to how to use some of the server-side features of Kattegat.
	</p>
	<p>
		View the source, have a tinker and keep an eye on your browser's console and your server terminal.
	</p>
	<h2>Storage</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="store.html">Demo</a></p>
	<p>
		Put, get and remove data on the server. This a way keeping track of data when users come and go, and for data to survive browser and server restarts.
	</p>
	<h2>Realtime</h2>
	<p><a href="realtime.html">Demo</a></p>
	<p>
		Exchange small bits of data across different devices and users in realtime. Unlike the Storage feature, realtime data is not stored, so it's best for streaming data - eg coming from user interaction or sensors.
